|1| i) Plot unit step, unit ramp, unit impulse signal using MATLAB. ii) Plot discrete signal using MATLAB. iii) Plot two different discrete signal and show their addition and subtraction using MATLAB. iv) Plot two different continuous signal using MATALB |
| 2  | Write a code for linear convolution and plot the signal using MATLAB. 
|3 |Write a code for auto correlation and cross-correlation and plot the signal using |
|4 |i) Take a continuous square wave signal, make a delay of that signal and do the auto correlation of the two signal. Write a code for that signal using MATLAB. ii) Take a discrete square wave signal, make a delay of that signal and do the auto correlation of the two signal. Write a code for that signal using MATLAB. iii) Write a code for calculating z-transform of a signal using MATLAB.   |
|5 |Write a code for calculating z-transform of a signal considering left and right sided by using MATLAB. |
